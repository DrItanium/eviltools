A collection of small evil tools I wrote when I was playing black team for a
CCDC invitational. Most of them are meant to be replace the binary in question
or sit in a malicious folder in the user's path. Useful for training people to
check their environment variables before working on a potentially compromised 
machine.

Expanding the scope to malicious libraries (potentially loaded with LD_PRELOAD),
malicious kernel modules, and other nogoodnickery.

Also including the tools for Salmon Linux in this repo.

At some point I want to write a whole library of malicious coreutils 
replacements (aka "evilcore" - thanks Ryan)
