A collection of small evil tools I wrote when I was playing black team for a CCDC invitational. Most of them are meant to be replace the binary in question or sit in a malicious folder in the user's path. Useful for training people to check their environment variables before working on a potentially compromised machine.

At some point I want to write a whole library of malicious coreutils replacements "evilcore" (thanks Ryan)
